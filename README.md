# Patternizer

## What?

A small Node.js script that generates a static pattern library from Drupal (Twig) based templates

## How?

TBD. Basically (in the future):
- `npm i @joinbox/patternizer`
- Create Pattern definitions in your project (w/ YAML, Markdown and Twig code)
- `patternize source/files/**.md destination``
- Deploy created static HTML files
